/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Calgwin Origins: Solo" application. 
 *  "Calgwin Origins: Solo" is a text-based dungeon crawler game, where the user
 *  has to find their way to the dungeon exit to win the game. The user can go
 *  into different rooms, pick up items & use items (or discard them), fight enemies,
 *  and talk to NPCs!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
 *  
 *  Base project made by Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes. 
 *  Final version built by Waseef Mohammad Khan, K-Number: K23080255
